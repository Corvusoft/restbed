Example
-------

```C++
#include <memory>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <restbed>

using namespace std;
using namespace restbed;

void post_method_handler( const shared_ptr< Session > session )
{
    const auto request = session->get_request( );

    int content_length = request->get_header( "Content-Length", 0 );

    session->fetch( content_length, [ ]( const shared_ptr< Session > session, const Bytes & body )
    {
        fprintf( stdout, "%.*s\n", ( int ) body.size( ), body.data( ) );
        session->close( OK, "Hello, World!", { { "Content-Length", "13" } } );
    } );
}

int main( const int, const char** )
{
    auto resource = make_shared< Resource >( );
    resource->set_path( "/resource" );
    resource->set_method_handler( "POST", post_method_handler );

    auto settings = make_shared< Settings >( );
    settings->set_port( 1984 );
    settings->set_default_header( "Connection", "close" );

    Service service;
    service.publish( resource );
    service.start( settings );

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Windows Build Instructions
--------------------------

For Microsoft Visual Studio instructions please see feature [#17](https://github.com/Corvusoft/restbed/issues/17).

Building restbed - Using vcpkg
------------------------------

You can download and install restbed using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) dependency manager:

    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
    ./vcpkg integrate install
    ./vcpkg install restbed

The restbed port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.


Documentation
-------------

This codebase is intended to be as self documenting as possible. We have supplied many [examples](https://github.com/Corvusoft/restbed/tree/master/documentation/example) and [test suites](https://github.com/corvusoft/restbed/tree/master/test) to help aid developers.

You can locate the latest design and API documentation [here](https://github.com/Corvusoft/restbed/tree/master/documentation).
